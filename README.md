# Data_Visualizaation-by-web.
I'm pleased to share that I have successfully completed the Data Visualization by Web Development program during the recent hackathon at Codegnan Institution.
This project is designed to generate four types of charts using user-provided data. It has been developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js.
